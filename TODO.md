# TODO

## google style guide

  - Every file must have a top-level comment including a brief overview of its contents. A copyright notice and author information are optional.
  - Any function that is not both obvious and short must be commented. Any function in a library must be commented regardless of length or complexity.

```bash
#######################################
# Get configuration directory.
# Globals:
#   SOMEDIR
# Arguments:
#   None
# Outputs:
#   Writes location to stdout
#######################################
function get_dir() {
  echo "${SOMEDIR}"
}
```
  - Comment tricky, non-obvious, interesting or important parts of your code.
